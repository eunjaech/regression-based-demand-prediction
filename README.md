# Regression-Based Demand Prediction

This project focuses on predicting continuous outcomes using regression and machine learning models.
The goal is to build an end-to-end, reproducible regression pipeline with an emphasis on
feature engineering, model comparison, and interpretability.

## Problem Statement
Accurately predicting demand or price is a core task in data-driven decision making.
In this project, we model a continuous target variable using structured tabular data
and evaluate how different regression techniques perform under the same feature space.

## Dataset
This project uses the **House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle.

- Source: Kaggle competition dataset
- Target variable: SalePrice
- Data type: Structured tabular data with numerical and categorical features

Due to Kaggle’s data usage policy, raw data files are **not included** in this repository.
Please download the dataset manually and place the files in the following directory:
